    "text": "I am a fourth-year PhD student in Cellular Biology at the University of Georgia, working in the Tarleton Lab. My research focuses on antigenic variation and DNA recombination in Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan parasite that causes Chagas disease. I am particularly interested in understanding how rapidly and extensively antigenic diversity is generated and maintained in parasite populations during infection within the host.\nMy training bridges wet-lab molecular parasitology and bioinformatics. Over the course of my PhD, I have integrated computational analyses into my research while working with Nanopore sequencing and genomics. As part of this interdisciplinary focus, I am also pursuing a Graduate Certificate in Bioinformatics, for which BIOS8060E is a required course."

I also genuinely enjoy teaching and explaining complex concepts in simple, intuitive ways, which is why my long-term goal is to become a professor."
